# The system-wide configuration files for recoll are located in:
#   /nix/store/hsms129vz38gj4qkhhj6k142iiqpvj94-recoll-1.20.6/share/recoll/examples
# The default configuration files are commented, you should take a look
# at them for an explanation of what can be set (you could also take a look
# at the manual instead).
# Values set in this file will override the system-wide values for the file
# with the same name in the central directory. The syntax for setting
# values is identical.
